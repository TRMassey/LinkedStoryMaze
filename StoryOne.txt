*****************    Choose Your Own Adventure Text Game     ****************

This is a short choose your own adventure maze. You will:
1. Create a character
2. Enter the maze
3. Find and take any tools you believe may come in handy for task completion
4. Find the end of the maze
5. Exit the maze, if all items have been found

You will start with no items in your pack.
You will start with 10 points of health. You will lose and die if your health
drops to 0 or below.
Every time you enter a room your timer will increase. If you wander through
enough rooms lost, you'll run out of time, but you will get some warning
messages before you lose. So watch your loops!

Good luck.

Well, you're going to die.

Even though, logically, you realize that the end is always looming, you never thought it would happen quite so fast. Or, you know, at the
hands of someone who looks like their eyes never quite reset after escaping a good lynching.

Stand up guy, that one. No way he deserved it or anything, right?

Anyway, point of the story, is you're going to die. All to impress a girl, and all because you couldn't keep your fat mouth shut. When
you were bragging at the local pub, you never once thought the lovely scented, scar covered gentleman to your left was an actual, honest
to God theif. News flash, he was, and here you are.

"Next!" the twitchy, bug-eyed gentleman calls.

Unfortunately, that means you, so you hobble up to the overturned beer barrel he's using for a desk.

"Name?" he asks.
