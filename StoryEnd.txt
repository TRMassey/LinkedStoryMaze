With a small smirk, you strut over to the desk and flick the hair pins out
from your bag. A turn here, a poke-poke there, and in a few minute (well..
you're going to say it was just a few minutes) the desk is open.

You reach inside the lower right side drawer, pulling out a jingling bag. The
rumors must be true -- some of the local taxes are kept by the collector.
Greed is universal, it seems.

You slip the bottle of victory booze our of your bag, and replace it wih the
pouch that shows your competence and worth in the guild. You actually did it.

But you didn't really think someone would go through the trouble of recounting
your valiant and noble (*cough*) tale if it wasn't a happy ending, right?


You won!
